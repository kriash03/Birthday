Open the file on VSCode (download in mac or any of your friends laptop)
download live server extension (it is block symbol on the bottom)
press fn+f1 in mac and type prefrences: open workspace settings (JSON) 
then just copy this code between the
{
    "liveServer.settings.CustomBrowser": "chrome",
    "liveServer.settings.port": 0
}
it should look like the above snippet
after everything is done just restart the VSCode once again
you will get button saying "go live" on bottom right corner 
click it and i hope you like it.
